  #### 1. Store wise sales analysis 
  
  From the analysis via Charts and table we can conclude that the store 4 makes the maximum profit and store 5 makes the least profit so to increase the profit the owner can discontinue the store no 5 and instead of that use the resources for other 4 stores to increase the sales
